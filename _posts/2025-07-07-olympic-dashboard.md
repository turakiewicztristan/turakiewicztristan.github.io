I've always been passionate about sports. As a long-time fencing enthusiast, I've developed a strong interest in Olympic sports and the stories behind the numbers — the medals, the countries, the athletes.

To combine this passion with my data skills, I created an interactive **Power BI dashboard** focused on the **Olympic Games**. The goal was to build a clear and engaging way to explore performance across nations, sports, and time.

### 🔍 Project Overview

- Cleaned and transformed a historical dataset on Olympic results.
- Designed **dynamic visualizations** to explore medals by country, year, and discipline.
- Highlighted key indicators such as **total medal count**, top-performing countries, and trends across editions.

This project allowed me to apply my skills in **data storytelling, dashboard design, and visual clarity**, while reflecting my personal interest in the Olympic movement. It’s a great example of how data can bring global events to life and help uncover meaningful insights.
