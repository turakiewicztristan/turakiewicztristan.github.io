In many organizations, valuable data products ‚Äî dashboards, KPIs, reports ‚Äî are scattered across multiple tools, teams, and folders. As a result, employees often struggle to find trusted, up-to-date insights, which leads to duplicated work, inconsistent reporting, and inefficient decision-making.

To address this, I led the design and development of a **Data Asset Gallery**, built entirely with **Power Apps** and **Power BI Embedded**. The goal was to create a centralized, interactive front-end to explore, filter, and access internal dashboards and analytics assets ‚Äî regardless of the tool they were built in.

---

## üéØ Project Objectives

- **Centralize access** to key dashboards and reports
- Improve **data discoverability** through categorization and search
- Enable **embedded viewing** of Power BI content within the gallery
- Support **governance** by exposing metadata (owner, refresh date, source)
- Ensure **responsiveness** across desktop and mobile devices

---

## üõ†Ô∏è Solution Overview

The solution was developed using:

- **Microsoft Power Apps**: as the low-code front-end for the data asset catalog
- **Power BI Embedded**: to integrate interactive dashboards securely within the app
- **SharePoint Online** (or **Dataverse**) as a backend to store metadata on each asset

Each "data asset" in the gallery is defined by a set of metadata fields:

- Title and description
- Business domain (Finance, Marketing, HR‚Ä¶)
- Report owner / contact
- Data source
- Last refresh date
- Type of visualization (dashboard, KPI set, report)
- Link to the original Power BI report (if applicable)
- Embedded token for previewing directly in the gallery

---

## üîç Key Features

- **Responsive Gallery View**: Browse and filter dashboards by category, team, or tags.
- **Search Functionality**: Search by keyword, business unit, or data domain.
- **Embedded Previews**: See the report directly inside the Power App via Power BI iframe tokens.
- **Metadata Display**: Each asset includes useful context (author, update date, etc.).
- **Role-based Access**: Optional filtering of assets depending on the user's role or permissions.
- **Maintenance Interface**: Admin users can easily add, edit, or archive entries from the app.

---

## üí° Benefits for the Organization

- **Faster insight access**: Users no longer search through email threads or bookmarks.
- **Improved data governance**: Visibility and ownership of each dashboard are clearly defined.
- **Better tool adoption**: The app encourages Power BI and Power Platform usage across teams.
- **Reduced redundancy**: Promotes reuse of existing reports and alignment on key metrics.
- **Scalability**: Easy to expand with more metadata, new asset types (e.g., Excel, Tableau), or automation.

---

## üöÄ Future Enhancements

To scale the solution further, potential next steps include:

- **Integration with Microsoft Purview or Azure Data Catalog** for richer metadata
- **Automated metadata extraction** via Power BI REST API
- **Versioning and asset lifecycle tracking**
- **Commenting or feedback system** on assets
- **Integration with Teams or Viva Connections** for better visibility

---

## üß© Technologies Used

- Microsoft Power Apps
- Power BI Embedded
- SharePoint Lists / Dataverse
- Power Automate (for automation logic)
- Office 365 environment (Teams, SharePoint, Identity)

This project showcases how **low-code platforms like Power Apps** can be leveraged to create **professional-grade internal tools**, accelerating digital transformation while maintaining scalability, governance, and performance. It's a perfect example of combining **data engineering, user experience, and business value**.
