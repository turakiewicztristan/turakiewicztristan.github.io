I'm a data-driven engineering graduate with strong skills in data analysis, statistics, and machine learning. I enjoy transforming raw data into clear insights through tools like Python, SQL, Power BI, and DBT.

Motivated, curious, and eager to keep learning, I'm open to all opportunities in the data field — from analytics and BI to data science or engineering — regardless of location or industry. I value impact, growth, and continuous improvement.
